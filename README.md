# Game Maker

### Learning objectives of the workshop
* Basics of the GameMaker software
* Algorithmic approach that characterizes writing computer programs
* The perception behind incremental program enhancement
* The objective behind event-based computer programming
* Develop an understanding of object-oriented programming
* If you want a head start on learning Java or C++, you can learn to use the GameMaker scripting language

### What is GameMaker?
* GameMaker is a software produced by YoYo games, in order to make people experience the thrill of making a computer do what they ask it to do, under the guise of producing a game
* GameMaker creates an event-driven, object-oriented simulation with a visual drag-and-drop interface
* GameMaker program executables can be run on a standalone computer, mobile device or from within a web page (after loading a plug-in)
* The “Lite” Edition can be downloaded for free! There is also a “Pro Edition” that costs $20

### Where can I get GameMaker?
* Go to http://www.yoyogames.com/legacy for Mac and http://game-maker.en.uptodown.com/windows for Windows
* As discussed earlier, The “Lite” Edition can be downloaded for free!  There is also a “Pro Edition” that costs $20.

### Resources ###
* All the things that we can add to the game are called resources.
* On the GameMaker software we can get them from any of the below areas:

### Resources by definitions ###
* _Sprites:_ Images that are used to show the objects 
* _Objects:_ The things in the game 
* _Rooms:_ The scenes (levels) in which the objects live 
* _Backgrounds:_ The images used as background for the rooms 
* _Instances:_ One particular occurrence of an object 
* _Sounds:_ These can be used in games, either as background music or as effects 
* _Scripts:_ Small pieces of code  that can be used to extend the possibilities of your game
* 
### How do I build a game in GameMaker? ###
* Describe the game you are trying to create  What is it supposed to do? What is it supposed to look like?
* Define the sprites
* BDefine the sounds
* Define the objects themselves, but not (yet) their events and actions
* Go back and define each object’s events and actions
* Define the room
* Put the object instances in the room


> **Note:** It is suggestible to define the objects first and their events and actions later because some of those actions will need to be asked for in terms of objects (that might not have been created yet).

### What next? ###
Now that we are acquainted  with the basic terminology required for working on the GameMaker software, let’s stretch ourselves to know more about various resources and their  functionalities.

### Sprites ###

* Sprite = picture
    - It can’t do anything but look good
* Visual representation of game objects
* Any common drawing format (gif, jpeg, tiff, png, pnt, cut, etc.)
* Single image
* Sprite things beyond where we go today..
    - Multiple image
        * Animated: explosions, walking
        * Rotated
 
### Adding Sprites ###
* Click “Pacman” on the menu bar
